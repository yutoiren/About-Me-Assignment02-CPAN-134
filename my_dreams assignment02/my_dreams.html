				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI've always found the concept of 'dreams' to be quite intriguing. Both in the wishful thinking sense of a future goal, and also in the stories, images, and experience that are unconsciously and subconsciously crafted by our minds. While I do possess many, yet somewhat incomplete 'dreams' and goals to motivate me throughout my life, as of right now, I would at least like to achieve the following: Acquire financial stability as an independent adult, get a career that I enjoy working in, and balance each of these things whilst having time to explore my other hobbies more in-depth. I imagine that once I have achieved all each of these dreams I would be quite happy and satisfied in life, or it would at least help to guide me more easily into a world that I can only excel in.</p>

				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn terms of dreams in the other sense, I find the idea of them fascinating. I like the thought of a world that is manifested by the things you have experienced first-hand, even possibly only subconsciously. I find it interesting the many different dreams one can experience, the quantity of them per night, the revisitation of dreams from the past, and its portrayal in different works of media. I think a really cool yet kind of archaic portrayal of the power of dreams can be found in the written works of H.P. Lovecraft. Though the writer had some controversial takes for sure, I find interesting the inspirations taken from his works in which a character is plagued by nightmares of a god that is of occult origin. Usually summoned by a group of devoted followers that exist merely to worship something greater, an old, 'dead' god that may appear in the dreams of individuals who have never conscious or unconsciously perceived them before.</p>

				<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI find the way that dreams can manifest in different ways, for different people, who have a variety of different experiences to be of a good inspiration for artwork as well. To take from one's own dreams and create displays from them has become more of a hotter topic in recent years as new art and video game projects pop up, and photoshop and image creation software as gotten better. The seamlessness of some virtual environments can be an eerie thing, but in this psychological stimuli it shows the beauty and power that each of us have.</p>
