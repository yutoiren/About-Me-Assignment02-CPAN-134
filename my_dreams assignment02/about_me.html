					<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI enjoy <strong>riding my bike</strong> because it allows me to get from one place to another pretty quickly. I also enjoy how it allows the rider to go at their own pace, increasing or decreasing their speed as they wish. I do enjoy going on walks as well, but I find that riding a bike is a lot more exciting as you get to take in all of your surroundings and nature at a faster pace than you would on foot.</p>

					<h4>Playing videogames</h4>

				<div class="text-article article">
					<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Ever since I was little, I've always found that <strong>playing videogames</strong> is a bunch of fun. As I grow up, I find the genres that I'm interested in change over time, with a focus right now on psychological-horror, indie games. I find this genre quite intriguing because it plays tricks on the player's mind, and creates a somewhat meta experience compared to other videogames. Some of my favorites of the genre right now are ranked as following:</p>

				<div class="text-article article">
					<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA little over a year ago, I started <strong>playing the piano</strong>. Though, since then, I still have not learned much music theory (I should probably spend more time practicing) however, I still know how to play a fair share of songs. These songs include <em>Clair de lune</em>, <em>Comptine d'un autre ete, l'apres-midi</em>, <em>Fur Elise</em>, and <em>Moonlight Sonata.</em></p>
